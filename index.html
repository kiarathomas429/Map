    <!-- STORY -->
<div class="container">
    <p> Tree shade in the South Bronx is growing. </p>

    <p> According to new data from the NYC Tree Canopy Study, the South Bronx has the biggest relative increase in tree canopy in the city. Mott Haven, Melrose and Port Morris showed a 2.97 percent increase in tree coverings and Hunts Point and Long Wood had a 2.16 percent growth. </p>

    <p> “Growing up in New York where we're always in a hustle and bustle of moving, I feel like green areas and trees give you a sense of peace,” Lovelyn Morfaw, a Bronx resident who believes more trees are needed in the area, said. </p>

    <p> The South Bronx is among the many Black and Brown low income neighborhoods that are negatively affected by air pollution and the lack of green spaces, resulting in urban heat islands and high asthma rates. The South Bronx is also constantly flooding due to the vulnerability of the peninsula during hurricane season. Trees could help with these problems, which residents have been battling for decades. </p>

    <p> “There are well-established social and biophysical benefits of urban forests,” Lindsay Campbell, a research social scientist from the U.S. Forest Service, said. “They provide known ecological benefits—cooling the air, providing shade, absorbing stormwater.  But they are also critical sites for fostering local engagement through planting, care, stewardship and education practices.” </p>
