<div class="container">
    <p> Tree shade in the South Bronx is growing. </p>

    <p> According to new data from the NYC Tree Canopy Study, the South Bronx has the biggest relative increase in tree canopy in the city. Mott Haven, Melrose and Port Morris showed a 2.97 percent increase in tree coverings and Hunts Point and Long Wood had a 2.16 percent growth. </p>

    <p> “Growing up in New York where we're always in a hustle and bustle of moving, I feel like green areas and trees give you a sense of peace,” Lovelyn Morfaw, a Bronx resident who believes more trees are needed in the area, said. </p>

    <p> The South Bronx is among the many Black and Brown low income neighborhoods that are negatively affected by air pollution and the lack of green spaces, resulting in urban heat islands and high asthma rates. The South Bronx is also constantly flooding due to the vulnerability of the peninsula during hurricane season. Trees could help with these problems, which residents have been battling for decades. </p>

    <p> “There are well-established social and biophysical benefits of urban forests,” Lindsay Campbell, a research social scientist from the U.S. Forest Service, said. “They provide known ecological benefits—cooling the air, providing shade, absorbing stormwater.  But they are also critical sites for fostering local engagement through planting, care, stewardship and education practices.” </p>

    <p> The Bronx has the highest percentage of children up to 12 years old who have been diagnosed with asthma, according to New York City Child Health’s 2015 Emotional Wellness and Development Survey. With Mott Haven known as “Asthma Alley” and more than 12 percent of adults in Hunts Point living with asthma, the South Bronx has one of the highest rates of asthma in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p>

    <p> “Urban forests help absorb air pollution, Mike Treglia, lead Scientist of Cities Program in New York at The Nature Conservancy and co-author of the report said. “New York City, work by the USDA Forest Service, has estimated that about 17,000 avoided deaths are because of air pollution are attributed to the urban forest, or it could be, which translates to about $78 million in savings.” </p>

    <p> Extreme heat is also an issue for the region and for the country as a whole, with it being the leading weather-related cause of death, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The South Bronx Unite collaborated on an urban heat island index study this past summer with Columbia University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which found that the South Bronx was hotter than many other communities in the city. </p>

    <p> “We’re seeing that there was a seven degree temperature difference in our area, in the area where we mapped, compared to the rural environments and suburban environments that had a lot more green space,” Dr. Melissa Barber, co-founder of the South Bronx Unite, said. “We saw that collectively over the course of the day.”</p>

  <p> Stewardship groups like Million Tree NYC and Bronx is Blooming are responsible for the planting and maintenance of trees in the area leading to the increase in tree shade. Million Trees NYC is a citywide initiative to plant one million trees in the span of a decade. The program attained their goal in 2015, two years earlier, expanding urban forests by 20 percent. Hunts Point and Morrisania were one of the six targeted neighborhoods for their Trees for Public Health Neighborhoods initiative. </p>

  <p> Many Bronx residents and environmentalists say that they are glad the South Bronx is getting shadier. The increase in shade hasn’t been greatly noticed by some, however, the steps taken to bring more greenery to the area has been noted. </p>

  <p> “I've seen incremental change,” Mychal Johnson, co-founder of South Bronx Unite, said. “I have seen trees being planted throughout the neighborhood. It hasn't been seemingly substantial, but there has been an increase. There’s been more trees for sure.” </p>
